However, there are billions of neurons in the human brain which together form brain structures. Many of the neuron types align and correlate. As you can imagine, in this environment some of the single-cell dipoles are cancelled out while the others add up to form much stronger signal. This group signal (from the single-cell dipoles that add up) along with a lot of noise can be recorded by EEG."

The subject participating in a cognitive neuroscience experiment is usually asked to perform the same task multiple times (watching something on a screen, remembering something, pressing buttons etc.). Then the recorded signals obtained during all the repetitions of the experiment are averaged, leading to noise removal and clearer data related to that task. This is related to so-called [evoked responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential).
